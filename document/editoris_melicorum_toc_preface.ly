    There are two staves below each hymn. The guitar part is written in Treble clef,
    octave below. And under that is a general/keyboard part in Bass clef, actual pitch.

    Note that when writing for guitar, the lowest pitch on standard notation is E2, or 
    on the first ledger line below the Bass clef. Extended range guitars can reach to
    B1, or under the second ledger line below the Bass clef.  Some guitars with
    longer scale lengths can go even lower to A1.
