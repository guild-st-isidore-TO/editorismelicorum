      This songbook example has some Gregorian-style hymns (in Standard Notation) with space for

      This project aims to create a digital music typesetting toolkit for use by music ministries
      in Catholic parishes. Its main objectives are building musical accompaniments around
      traditional hymns (the kind written in Gregorian notation), and laying them out into
      documents for use by the community.

    \markup \wordwrap {
      As initial steps, the Editoris project is building some proofs of concept:
      songbooks with traditional style accompaniments written out for classical guitar.
      And the sheets to enable musicians to create those arrangements.

      The music was sourced from GregoBase (https://gregobase.selapa.net/scores.php) and
      converted by the Editoris into modern standard notation.

      There are two staves below each hymn. The guitar part is written in Treble clef,
      octave below. And under that is a general/keyboard part in Bass clef, actual pitch.

    \markup \wordwrap {
      Note that when writing for guitar, the lowest pitch on standard notation is E2, or 
      on the first ledger line below the Bass clef. Extended range guitars can reach to
      B1, or under the second ledger line below the Bass clef.  Some guitars with
      longer scale lengths can go even lower to A1.
